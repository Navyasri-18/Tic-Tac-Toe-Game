# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A fun, interactive, and responsive Tic-Tac-Toe web game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project demonstrates clean logic, intuitive design, and asynchronous gameplay control using async/await for smooth performance.

This version also includes two special features — a Score Tracker that maintains wins for both players until refresh, and a Restart Button for quick replays.

## 🧩 Description

The **Tic-Tac-Toe Game** allows two players (“X” and “O”) to compete in a classic 3×3 grid.
After each move, the game automatically checks for a winner or a draw, updates scores dynamically,
and resets the board when needed — all without reloading the page.

This project demonstrates clean **JavaScript event handling**, **dynamic DOM updates**,
and modern **async/await** logic for a smooth gaming experience.

📊 **Score Tracker** – Tracks wins of “X” and “O” until page refresh<br>
🔁 **Restart Button** – Resets only the board without losing scores<br>
⚡ **Asynchronous Flow** – Uses `async/await` for non-blocking game logic<br>
🎨 **Responsive UI** – Scales seamlessly on desktop and mobile<br>
💬 **Clean Design** – Simple, minimalistic layout with smooth transitions<br>
